# Do local development, containerize and migrate to Docker Hub using Appsody


In this tutorial, I show you how to use a new open source project, Appsody, to create an application locally and then build and deploy that application to a Docker Hub so you can use it on any cloud or platform that supports Docker images. After completing this tutorial, you will see how Appsody enables you to containerize a Node.js Express application without having to be an expert in container technology. 



## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you need to:
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your local machine.
2. Install VS code [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for local development.

## Steps
1.	[Clone the application](#1-clone-the-application)
2.	[Open the application in Visual Code](#2-open-the-application-in-visual-code)
3.	Install Appsody on your local machine 
4.	Initialize Appsody in your project
5.	Change the application on your local machine
6.	Build and deploy the application to Docker Hub



# Letâ€™s move to lab part:
Follow the below steps to deploy your first application using Appsody:
Application (Nodejs with express) . 

*IMPORTANT NOTE*
You must have docker installed on your local machine . 
1.Get Docker from here :https://docs.docker.com/install/
2. We are using Visual Studio Code for local development :https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Step 2:Open the application in Visual Code

## Step 3:Install Appsody
https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/installation

## Step 4: Initialize Appsody in our application
 .First, choose a stack that closely resembles your existing project.
 .Use appsody list to view the available stacks'
 .As we are using Node.js with express so we will use that stack.

 .Run Appsody init command to create the templete
 .Once the templete is successfully intailized , there will be  ".appsody-config.yml" created.

## Step 5: Let's do some local development

When a source code project is initialized with Appsody, you get a local Appsody development container. "Appsody run" starts the development container in run mode in the foreground. Appsody watches your local project directory for file changes and updates the application to reflect code changes as you develop.

Our container is running on PORT 3000.

## Step 6: Now it's time to build and deploy our application on Docker Hub
When we've finished the local development work for our Appsody project,we will containeried our application and upload it on Docker Hub, so that we can easily deploy it to a suitable runtime infrastructure such as IBM cloud platform or any other.

1. We will use the "appsody build" command to generate a deployment Docker image without writing any dockerfile.

2.Once your image is successfully built , we will be able to see "app-deploy.yml".

3. Run "docker images" command and see your image is created on your local machine.

4. Let's login into Docker Hub and create a new repository.

5. Finally push the image to Docker Hub and access the image any where .

6 . Check your local image is successfully uploaded to your Docker Registry.In the future you can pull the image any anywhere by using "docker pull ahsanoffical/appsody:testing" command.
